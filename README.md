# Brainfuck Interpreter

An interpreter written in Java for [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck). Brainfuck is a simple language with only 8 operations. It is turing-complete - although it's not very practical to write programs with it.

The application requires at least JDK7 and JavaFX. JUnit 4 is also used for comprehensive testing.
